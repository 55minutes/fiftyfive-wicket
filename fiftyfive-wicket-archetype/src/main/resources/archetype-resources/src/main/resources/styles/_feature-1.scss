/*-----[ feature 1 ]------------------------------------------------------------
| Styles for an individual feature, page or section of the application/site.
| Create a new stylesheet per feature or section. If the feature-specific styles
| are too many to practically be in one file, create a new directory containing
| styles for that feature:
|
|   _feature-1.scss
|   feature-2/
|     _sub-feature-1.scss
|     _sub-feature-2.scss
|   _feature-3.scss
