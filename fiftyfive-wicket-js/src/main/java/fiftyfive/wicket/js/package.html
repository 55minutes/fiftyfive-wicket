  <p>The fiftyfive-wicket-js project features JavaScript dependency resolution, 
  merged JavaScript resources, and a clean way to integrate external JavaScript 
  files with Wicket pages and components.</p>


  <h2 id="dependency-resolution">Dependency resolution</h2>
  
  <p>Whenever you reference a JavaScript file using the fiftyfive-wicket-js set 
  of classes and utilities, that JavaScript file is scanned for special 
  dependency markers.</p>

  <p>For example, let's say you have a MyPanel component that brings along its 
  own JavaScript behavior in a file called <code>MyPanel.js</code>. That 
  JavaScript, in turn, requires jQuery and a file called <code>common.js</code> 
  in order to work.</p>

  <p>You can document those dependencies and get automatic dependency 
  resolution by adding these lines to <code>MyPanel.js</code>:</p>

  <pre class="example">
//= require jquery
//= require common</pre>

  <p><em>Presto!</em> Now when you whenever you use the MyPanel component in 
  your application, <code>jquery.js</code> and <code>common.js</code> will 
  automatically be added to the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>


  <h3>Where does this magic happen?</h3>
  
  <p>This dependency resolution is unique to fiftyfive-wicket-js, and thus only 
  works when you interact with a JavaScript file through one of the 
  fiftyfive-wicket-js classes. Here are the classes that are 
  dependency-resolution aware:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><a href="JavaScriptDependency.html">JavaScriptDependency</a> for adding 
    a JavaScript file to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> from a Wicket page or 
    component (as in the MyPanel example)</li>


    <li><a href="DomReadyTemplate.html">DomReadyTemplate</a> for injecting dynamic DOM-ready JavaScript from a 
    component (this is how JQueryDatePicker works)</li>

    <li><a href="MergedJavaScriptBuilder.html">MergedJavaScriptBuilder</a> for 
    delivering many JavaScript files in a
    single, efficient HTTP response (more on this below)</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>How do I change or disable it?</h3>
  
  <p><a 
  href="JavaScriptDependencySettings.html">JavaScriptDependencySettings</a> has 
  many methods for tweaking and disabling parts of the dependency resolution 
  system. You can easily turn the entire thing off by calling 
  <code>JavaScriptDependencySettings.get().setSprocketsParser(null)</code>.</p>



  <h3>Where do I put my JavaScript files?</h3>
  
  <p>The short answer is that fiftyfive-wicket-js searches a set of 
  configurable classpath locations. You can specify these locations using 
  <a href="JavaScriptDependencySettings.html">JavaScriptDependencySettings</a>. 
  More specifically:</p>


  <ul>

    <li>When you ask fiftyfive-wicket-js to include jQuery – for example, by 
    using <code>//= require jquery</code> or <code>add(new 
    JavaScriptDependency("jquery"))</code> – the <code>jQuery.js</code> file is 
    loaded from the classpath based on the 
    <code><a href="JavaScriptDependencySettings.html#getJQueryResource()">JavaScriptDependencySettings#getJqueryResource()</a></code> setting. By
    default, the latest version of jQuery is bundled with fiftyfive-wicket-js, 
    so you should be good to go. However, if you prefer a different version, or 
    if you want to disable auto-inclusion of jQuery, you can change this 
    setting.</li>

    <li>Likewise, if you request jQuery UI, fiftyfive-wicket-js is bundled with 
    the latest version and will load it. Furthermore, it will also 
    automatically include a link in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> to a jQuery 
    UI CSS theme. Again, you can change these resources or disable this 
    behavior through <a 
    href="JavaScriptDependencySettings.html">JavaScriptDependencySettings</a>.
    </li>


    <li>For all other files, fiftyfive-wicket-js will append a <code>.js</code> 
    extension to the library name and search for that JavaScript file in the 
    classpath. Use <code><a href="JavaScriptDependencySettings.html#addLibraryPath(java.lang.Class,%20java.lang.String)">JavaScriptDependencySettings#addLibraryPath()</a></code> to specify the 
    exact search locations. If you use the fiftyfive-wicket-archetype to 
    bootstrap your project, this will be already set up for you to point to a 
    location in <code>src/main/resources/&lt;your-package&gt;/</code>.</li>

  </ul>

  
  <h3>What's that syntax look like again?</h3>
  
  <p>Within your JavaScript files, declare dependencies like this, and 
  fiftyfive-wicket will scan the classpath to locate them, as described 
  above:</p>

  <pre class="example">
//= require jquery
//= require my-library</pre>

  <p>If you want to include a JavaScript file <em>from the same directory</em>, 
  prefix the JavaScript file name with <code>./</code>, like this</p>

  <pre class="example">
//= require ./another-file-in-this-directory</pre>
  <p>Some more details:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>You can surround the library name with quotes, but it is completely 
    optional.</li>

    <li>Previous versions of fiftyfive-wicket-js used a slightly different 
    syntax. See <code><a href="JavaScriptDependencySettings.html#setSprocketsParser(fiftyfive.wicket.js.locator.SprocketsParser)">JavaScriptDependencySettings#setSprocketsParser</a></code> for further 
    explanation.</li>

    <li>This syntax and behavior is heavily inspired by the <a 
    href="http://getsprockets.org/">Sprockets</a> project. However Sprockets is 
    in no way included or related to fiftyfive-wicket-js. Most notably, more 
    advanced Sprockets delcarations like <code>require_tree</code> are not 
    supported by fiftyfive-wicket-js.</li>


  </ul>
  
  
  <h2>Merged JavaScript resources</h2>
  
  <p>Merging JavaScript can improve the performance of your web application by 
  reducing the number of browser roundtrips required to load individual 
  JavaScript files. You can merge JavaScript easily in fiftyfive-wicket-js. 
  Here's how it works.</p>
  
  <p>A good thing to remember as you proceed: <b>fiftyfive-wicket-js's 
  <a href="MergedJavaScriptBuilder.html">MergedJavaScriptBuilder</a> tells 
  Wicket <em>how</em> to optimize delivery of
  JavaScript resources. It is still up to your pages and components to tell 
  Wicket <em>which</em> resources to send.</b></p>


  <p>Therefore, first you should follow the standard Wicket practice of 
  declaring your JavaScript resources per Wicket page or component.</b> Don't 
  worry about optimizing <em>how</em> the resources will be served; at this 
  point just be concerned with what JavaScript files each page of your app 
  needs to be functional. You can do this with JavaScriptDependency, or in 
  plain Wicket by overriding <code>Component#renderHead()</code>.</p>

  <p>Once your app is fully functioning, only then should you worry about 
  resource merging. In your <code>Application#init()</code>, use 
  <a href="MergedJavaScriptBuilder.html">MergedJavaScriptBuilder</a> to list 
  all of the JavaScript files you would like
  merged together. Then, whenever it comes time for Wicket to add a JavaScript 
  file to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, the merged version will be used in its 
  place.</p>

  
  <p>Refer to the <a 
  href="MergedJavaScriptBuilder.html">MergedJavaScriptBuilder documentation</a> 
  for a complete example.</p>



  <h2>Integrating JavaScript with Wicket components</h2>
  
  <p>With fiftyfive-wicket-js you have three powerful options for integrating 
  JavaScript with your Wicket pages and components. Each is designed for a 
  specific purpose.</p>

  
  <ul>

    <li><a href="JavaScriptDependency.html">JavaScriptDependency</a> allows you 
    to programmatically add a JavaScript
    file reference to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. Wicket provides something 
    like this out of the box with <code>Component#renderHead()</code>, but 
    JavaScriptDependency is a more convenient API and also provides the 
    dependency resolution feature as described above.</li>

    <li><a href="DomReadyScript.html">DomReadyScript</a> is similar to 
    JavaScriptDependency, but rather than
    adding a file reference to the head, it adds a JavaScript code string that 
    will run on DOM ready (i.e. after the page has rendered). Again, Wicket can 
    do this out of the box if you override <code>Component#renderHead()</code>, 
    but <a href="DomReadyScript.html">DomReadyScript</a> has advantages of a convenient behavior-based syntax, 
    and faster jQuery-based DOM-ready code.</li>

    <li><a href="DomReadyTemplate.html">DomReadyTemplate</a> is a dynamic 
    mashup of JavaScriptDependency and
    <a href="DomReadyScript.html">DomReadyScript</a>. A <a 
    href="DomReadyTemplate.html">DomReadyTemplate</a> loads a JavaScript file, 
    then pre-processes it, giving you the ability to dynamically alter the script 
    based the markup ID or other data contained in your Wicket component. The 
    resulting script is then added inline to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and 
    will execute on DOM-ready. <a 
    href="DomReadyTemplate.html">DomReadyTemplate</a> is the best option for
    client-side widgets. <a 
    href="datetime/JQueryDatePicker.html">JQueryDatePicker</a> is an example 
    implementation.</li>

    
  </ul>
